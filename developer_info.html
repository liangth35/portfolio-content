			Game Science is a video game developer startup headquartered in Shenzhen, China. 
			Its full name is Game Science Interactive Technology Co., Ltd. In 2014, 7 core game 
			developers left Tencent Games and founded Game Science. Accourding to the art director, 
			Yang Qi, the main reason why he left Tencent was that Tencent marginalized the development of PC games and 
			focused instead on mobile games. As a huge fan of PC games, Yang Qi thought that only PC games can provide 
			players with immersive experience. So, he decided to quit his well-paid job and pursue his dream by founding 
			a startup with several like-minded friends where he can continue to develop AAA level PC games.

			In 2015, Game Science released their first game named Legends of 100 Heroes. It was a free-to-play 
			2D mobile role-playing game adapted from the stories of the Tree Kingdoms period. 
			The game was not neither that high-quality nor on PC and ran for only 2 years before shutting down, 
			but it managed to earn the start-up capital for the company.

			Two years later, in 2017, Game Science released an RTS game named Art of War: Red Tides. This game was a 
			multiplayer strategy game like Starcraft. It was launched on steam and turned out to be a great success. 
			This time, the company finally earned enough money to start the development of their own AAA PC 
			game: Black Myth: Wukong.

			Game Science (游戏科学) is a video game developer startup headquartered in Shenzhen and Hangzhou, China. 
			Its full name is Game Science Interactive Technology Co., Ltd. (深圳市游科互动科技有限公司). 
			In 2014, 7 core game developers left Tencent Games and founded Game Science. Accourding to the art director, 
			Yang Qi, the main reason why he left Tencent was that Tencent marginalized the development of PC games and 
			focused instead on mobile games. As a huge fan of PC games, Yang Qi thought that only PC games can provide 
			players with immersive experience. So, he decided to quit his well-paid job and pursue his dream by founding 
			a startup with several like-minded friends where he can continue to develop AAA level PC games.

			Ironically, the first and second game developed by Game Science were both mobile games. In 2015, they released 
			their first game, a 2D card game named 100 Heros. It was not very successful and ran for only 2 years. 
			Two years later, in 2017, Game Science released an RTS mobile game: Art of War: Red Tides. This game turned out 
			to be a great success, and the company finally earned enough money to start the development of its own AAA PC 
			game: Black Myth: Wukong.

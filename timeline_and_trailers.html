			Development Timeline of Black Myth: Wukong
		</h1>
		<p>
			In 2016, Yang Qi, the art director, proposed the project Black Myth: Wukong. 
			But the team thought it was too early for them to start this project.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 2017, after the success of Art of War: Red Tides, Game Science started the 
			development of Black Myth: Wukong. The progress was slow due to lack of manpower.
		</p>
		<p>
			On Aug. 19, 2020, the team released the first trailer in order to recuirt more 
			personnels. Surprisingly, the 13 minute trailer went viral: it got 45 million
			views on bilibili, a video site in China, and 10 million views on youtube. In 
			a few days, Game Science received more than 10000 resumes from all around the 
			world, while they expected to hire only 100.

			In Mar. 2021, Game Science accepted the investment from Tencent Games, but under 
			the condition that Tencent Games doesn't seek control of the company.
		</p>
		<p>
			On Aug. 19 2021, the second trailer was released. This was the first trailer after 
			the team switched the game engine from UE4 to UE5.

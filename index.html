			Black Myth: Wukong is an upcoming 3D action role-playing game by Chinese developer 
			Game Science. The story is adapted from the 16th century Chinese novel 
			<i>The Journey to the West</i>. A 1986 TV-series on the same story is a shared
			childhood memory of all Chinese people, which makes the expectation on this game 
			incredibly high. On Aug. 20, 2020, the developer released a 13-minute pre-alpha 
			gameplay video and attracted the attention of gamers around the world. The 
			video got 2 million views on youtube and 10 million views on bilibili in one day. 
			Now, the game is still under development, in to a 2020 interview with IGN China, 
			Game Science said they plan to release Black Myth: Wukong by 2023.

		<p>
			The game is said to be Souls-like, meaning it will feature hardcore fighting and 
			high difficulty.In this game, the player plays as a monkeyman who is capable of 
			transforming into any animal or person, surfing on the cloud, and altering the 
			size of his weapon. These are all Wukong's signature skills, but according 
			to the first trailer, the monkeyman player controls is not Wukong himself. 
			Official information about the plot of the game is very limited, but some players have 
			deduced from the trailers and the name of the game that in the world line of the 
			game, Wukong was chased by heavenly soldiers and failed to become a buddha in the end.
